# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

I have compiled a comprehensive collection of solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems from websites such as LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. My main motive in creating this resource was to provide a valuable tool for others to improve their skills and knowledge in this field.

I have made a concerted effort to follow best practices while coding these solutions, including making the code modular, using clear variable names, and applying object-oriented principles. These practices not only help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the code, but also ensure that it is easily understood and useful to others.

I began my coding journey with C++, but later transitioned to Java due to its strict adherence to good coding practices and principles. I have found that Java's emphasis on these principles has helped me to become a more proficient and effective programmer.

Overall, this is an ongoing journey for me, and I hope to continually expand and improve upon this resource in the future. I am confident that my solutions and adherence to best practices will be of great value to others looking to enhance their skills and knowledge in the field of data structures and algorithms.
